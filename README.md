Project Management was all about how to work on and with a team. I was placed in a group with 3 of my fellow students, and we were charged with running a team via a simulation centered building a house. We had to allocate resources, delegate labor, and analyze the outcomes of the decisions we made on a weekly basis. We also had to make network diagrams, gantt charts, perform risk analysis, and consider stakeholder input. The attached file shows the end product of a semester long project.
